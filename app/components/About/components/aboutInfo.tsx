            I fell in love with photography capturing runners in motion, and it quickly grew into a passion for candid, editorial, and storytelling photography. 
            I believe photos aren&apos;t just images, theyâ€™re stories that remind us of our strength, beauty, and uniqueness.At the core of my work is a simple mission: to help people feel seen.
